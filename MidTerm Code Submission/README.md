# Important Note

## I did not know to be honest we had to save all our made codes for such a submission. So, I had worked on VS Code and deleted all codes after I was done. So, in the code submissions, you can only see 5-6 problems solved for each lesson. These were some problems I selected after the announcement of the submssion and I did it again.

### I was not able to do all the questions on the website during my normal sessions too, some were difficult, but some questions which i have taken help for and now know how to do them, have also been included.
